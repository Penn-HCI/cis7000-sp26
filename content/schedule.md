[**The Computer for the 21st Century**](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1911297/files/157048109?wrap=1). Mark Weiser. Scientific American. September 1991, pp. 94-104.

This is one of the most influential, highly-cited papers in all of human-computer interaction. Weiser's vision of ubiquitous computing articulated a vision in which computing recedes into the background rather than stands as a focal point of our attention. Researchers and practitioners have chased this vision since 1991. We read this article because it is the foundation upon which much of the Interaction component of the class sits. What do you think about Weiser's differentiation between calm computation that recedes into infrastructure, and simply spreading computers around everywhere in the environment? What are the implications of such a vision?

[**Tangible Bits: Towards Seamless Interfaces Between People, Bits and Atoms**](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1911297/files/157048059?wrap=1). Hiroshi Ishii, Brygg Ulmer. CHI 1997.

The Tangible Bits paper sits alongside Weiser's Ubiquitous Computing paper as one of the foundational works of modern HCI. It came out several years after Weiser's article, but in many ways, was the innovation that made Weiser's vision actionable. Tangible bits takes a strong stance that input and output need to be aligned in concrete physical artifacts, whereas Weiser allowed digital outputs such as screens and projectors. This paper has spawned many, many projects and even entire conferences. What tradeoffs does Tangible Bits make through its strict adherence to input/output co-location?

[**BeWell: A Smartphone Application to Monitor, Model and Promote Wellbeing**](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1911297/files/157058191?wrap=1). Nicholas D. Lane, Mashfiqui Mohammod, Mu Lin, Xiaochao Yang, Hong Lu, Shahid Ali, Afsaneh Doryab, Ethan Berke, Tanzeem Choudhury, Andrew T. Campbell. Pervasive computing technologies for healthcare 2012.

A smartphone contains a variety of sensors that can be used to track all kinds of detailed user activity. This work shows how such sensor data can be combined together to estimate the overall wellbeing of the user. They suggest visualizations to communicate both the activities and wellbeing scores to users. Which visualizations would be most useful to you if you used this system? Which do you think would be most useful to others? Why?

[**Privacy as Contextual Integrity**](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1911297/files/157058180?wrap=1). Helen Nissenbaum. Washington Law Review 2004.

How do we manage the privacy tradeoffs inherent in ubicomp technology? Nissembaum's theory of contextual integrity is a central idea in ubiquitous computing, and one that helps us articulate how and when we might view our privacy as been violated in IoT or ubicomp contexts. What do you think of the theory? How might you extend it?
